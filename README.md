This project is for you to have,  your own 80’s film collection. Where you can create, edit and remove film from you collection. 


Technologies we used. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap,  we are also using the MERN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express and React.
Our file structure uses Models, Views, Controllers, Public.

This was a good project to help us understand Github and it’s branches. Through merge conflict and small bugs we where able to figure out how to fix these problems and also learn how to use GitHub better. 

In this project we came across some bugs that seemed hard at first but once we searched and understand what to look for it became more fun. Doing this project made things sink in and help understand how every thing connects and work together even more. 

This was a fun and exiting project. 


TECHNICAL CHALLENEGES:

- While we originally intended to, we had difficulty finding a way to keep movies aligned in their original rows while expanding their information and editing panes. As it is, the site pushes the following rows down to allow space for these elements.


POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:

- User login functionality that can track individual users' movie collections. Collections would take the form of an array of movie ID's stored with the user information.

- A seperate page for each movie's extended details, and screenshots of each movie. Right now, all movie information is displayed in dropdown panes.

- A more detailed and inttuitive "Create Movie" pane, which right now takes the form of a series of horizontal text boxes.


TRIUMPHS:

- We obtained an extrremely effective color scheme from colorhunt.co, a minimalist color scheme library organized by date posted as well as times liked. We felt that the color scheme we used captured a sense of the bombastic yet aged nature of 80's pop media.

- The aspect ratios of all movie posters were very similar, allowing us to arrange the titles in a grid without directly editing the images.
